# Learning Go by making stuff

> Theory and practice are like two wheels of a wagon - you'll only go in circles if you neglect one of them.

This is a playground for learning Go.
The general idea is to create a feature branch for every concept, idea, or prototype you want to explore.
Don't hesitate to create branches upon branches.

What goes in the master branch?
It might just be a single root commit that forks into different lines of development, or it might receive commits from other branches.
Don't overthink it.
Just start moving and figure it out as you go along.
